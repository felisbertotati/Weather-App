# Weather-App

## Description

In this project I have to create a weather dashboar application that allow users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choice.
I used aN API server calls open weather open weather so with that I have access their data and functionality by making requests with spcecific parameters to a URL,
to create this application I have to follow the instructions:

 * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.

 * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

    - The city name

    - The date

    - An icon representation of weather conditions

    - The temperature

    - The humidity

    - The wind speed

 * When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

    - The date

    - An icon representation of weather conditions

    - The temperature

    - The humidity

 * When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
